# Problem set 2

Problem set 2 consists of 3 problems:

* [Readability](/pset2/readability/)
    * Implement a program that computes the approximate grade level needed to comprehend some text
* [Caesar](/pset2/caesar/) (less)
    * Implement a program that encrypts messages using Caesarâ€™s cipher
* [Substitution](/pset2/substitution/) (more)
    * Implement a program that implements a substitution cipher

The "less" / "more" indicates the difficulty level of problem. Students are given the choice of selecting between a less/more challenging problem to complete but both have been done for more and practice learning.
