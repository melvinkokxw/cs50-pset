# Hexademical system

Other than binary, another number system used in computers is the hexadecimal system. While the binary system is base-2, the hexadecimal system is a base-16 system. It uses the symbols "0"–"9" and "A"–"F". Hexadecimal numbers are prefixed with `0x` to differentiatie them

The addresses for memory use and the RGB color system use the hexadecimal system.
