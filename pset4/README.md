# Problem set 4

Problem set 4 consists of 3 problems:

* [Filter](/pset4/filter/less/) (less)
    * Implement a program that applies the following filters to BMPs
        * Grayscale
        * Sepia
        * Reflection
        * Blur
* [Filter](/pset4/filter/more/) (more)
    * Implement a program that applies the following filters
        * Grayscale
        * Reflection
        * Blur
        * Edges
* [Recover](/pset4/recover/)
    * Implement a program that recovers JPEGs from a forensic image

The "less" / "more" indicates the difficulty level of problem. Students are given the choice of selecting between a less/more challenging problem to complete but both have been done for more practice.
