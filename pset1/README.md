# Problem Set 1

Problem set 1 consists of 5 problems:

* [hello](/pset1/hello/)
* [mario (less)](/pset1/mario/less/)
* [mario (more)](/pset1/mario/more/)
* [cash (less)](/pset1/cash/)
* [credit (more)](/pset1/credit/)

where "less" / "more" indicates the difficulty level of problem. Students are given the choice of selecting between a less/more challenging problem to complete but both have been done for more and practice learning.
