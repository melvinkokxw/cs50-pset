# Problem Set 0

The solution for problem set 0 was written in [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/).

## Solution requirements

The requirements for the solution are as follows:

> * Your project must have at least two sprites, at least one of which must resemble something other than a cat.
> * Your project must have at least three scripts total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite).
> * Your project must use at least one condition, one loop, and one variable.
> * Your project must use at least one sound.
> * Your project should be more complex than most of those demonstrated in lecture (many of which, though instructive, were quite short) but it can be less complex than Ivyâ€™s Hardest Game. As such, your project should probably use a few dozen puzzle pieces overall.
